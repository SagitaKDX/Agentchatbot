# üöÄ Backend File Processing Enhancements

## Overview

The backend has been significantly enhanced with comprehensive file processing capabilities that integrate seamlessly with the AI agent. Users can now upload documents which are automatically processed, indexed, and used as context for agent conversations.

## üéØ Key Features

### ‚úÖ **Smart File Processing**
- **Multi-format support**: PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT, MD files
- **Text extraction**: Automatic content extraction from all supported formats
- **Intelligent indexing**: Keywords extraction and content summarization
- **Deduplication**: File hash-based duplicate detection

### ‚úÖ **AI Agent Integration**
- **Context-aware responses**: Agent uses uploaded file content as context
- **Relevance scoring**: Smart matching of files to user queries
- **Dynamic context**: Automatically selects most relevant files for each question

### ‚úÖ **File Management**
- **Upload processing**: Real-time text extraction and analysis
- **File listing**: View all uploaded files with metadata
- **Search functionality**: Find files by keywords
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive analytics on uploaded files
- **Deletion**: Clean removal of files and their processed data

## üîß New API Endpoints

### File Upload & Processing
```
POST /api/agent/upload
```
- Uploads and processes files in one step
- Returns file metadata, keywords, and summary
- Automatically integrates with agent context

### File Management
```
GET    /api/agent/files           # List all processed files
GET    /api/agent/files/<id>      # Get specific file details
DELETE /api/agent/files/<id>      # Delete file and its data
POST   /api/agent/files/search    # Search files by keywords
GET    /api/agent/files/stats     # Get processing statistics
```

### Enhanced Agent Chat
```
POST /api/agent/chat
```
- Now automatically includes relevant file context
- Returns info about context usage
- Provides smarter, document-informed responses

## üìÅ File Processing Pipeline

### 1. **Upload & Validation**
- File type checking (PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT, MD)
- Size validation (10MB limit)
- Security scanning via middleware

### 2. **Content Extraction**
- **PDF**: Uses PyPDF2 for text extraction
- **DOCX**: Uses python-docx for document parsing  
- **TXT/MD**: Direct text reading with encoding handling

### 3. **Intelligent Analysis**
- **Keyword extraction**: Advanced stop-word filtering
- **Summarization**: Smart content summarization
- **Metadata collection**: File size, word count, processing timestamp

### 4. **Indexing & Storage**
- **Hash generation**: MD5-based file identification
- **Memory indexing**: Fast in-memory search capabilities
- **Context preparation**: Optimized for AI agent consumption

## üß† AI Agent Context System

### **Smart Context Selection**
When a user asks a question, the system:

1. **Analyzes the query** for keywords and intent
2. **Scores all files** based on content relevance
3. **Selects top matches** (up to 5 files)
4. **Builds context string** with file summaries
5. **Enhances user message** with relevant background

### **Example Context Flow**
```
User Query: "How do neural networks work?"

System finds: 
- ai_guide.pdf (score: 15) - Contains neural network explanations
- ml_basics.txt (score: 8) - Has machine learning fundamentals

Context sent to agent:
=== From file: ai_guide.pdf ===
Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks...

=== From file: ml_basics.txt ===  
Machine learning algorithms include various approaches including neural networks...

User Question: How do neural networks work?
Please answer using the context from uploaded files when relevant.
```

- Content-based recommendations
- Processing history tracking

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **New Services**
- `FileProcessor`: Core file processing engine
- Enhanced `BedrockAgentService`: Context-aware agent interactions
- Security middleware: File validation and safety checks

### **Memory Management**
- Efficient in-memory file indexing
- Smart context caching
- Automatic cleanup for deleted files

### **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Graceful degradation for processing failures
- Detailed logging for debugging

## üß™ Testing

### **Automated Test Suite**
Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
cd backend
python test_file_processing.py
```

Tests include:
- File upload and processing
- Text extraction accuracy
- Agent context integration
- Search functionality
- Statistics generation

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### **1. Upload a Technical Document**
```python
# Upload a PDF about AI concepts
import requests

with open('ai_handbook.pdf', 'rb') as f:
    response = requests.post(
        'http://localhost:5000/api/agent/upload',
        files={'file': f}
    )

# Response includes keywords, word count, and summary
data = response.json()
print(f"Extracted {data['data']['word_count']} words")
print(f"Keywords: {data['data']['keywords']}")
```

### **2. Ask AI with Document Context**
```python
# Ask about content from uploaded files
response = requests.post(
    'http://localhost:5000/api/agent/chat',
    json={'message': 'Explain machine learning algorithms'}
)

# Agent response uses uploaded document context
data = response.json()
print(f"Used context: {data['data']['used_file_context']}")
print(f"Response: {data['data']['message']}")
```

### **3. Search Uploaded Files**
```python
# Find files containing specific topics
response = requests.post(
    'http://localhost:5000/api/agent/files/search',
    json={'keywords': ['neural networks', 'deep learning']}
)

files = response.json()['data']['files']
for file in files:
    print(f"{file['original_filename']} - Relevance: {file['relevance_score']}")
```
